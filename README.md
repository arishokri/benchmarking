# Benchmarking
Used for benchmarking CPU and GPU.

## For CPU
Start with fib(35) and you can increase in smaller steps. ~5

## For GPU
You can use either pytorch or tensorflow.
Pytorch is a newer implementation in this git and is the preferred method.

Start with a smaller matrix_size e.g. 10,000 and increase from there. Also start with moderate iterations (e.g. 100) and increase only if necessary.

## Geekbench_ML
You can find the results for Geekbench ML scripts here. The module can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.geekbench.com/ml/).
